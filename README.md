I faceced many challenges. Going into this project I though it would be simpler because of the use of Bootstrap, but I quickly realized that Bootstrap has a very specific layout that I needed to tweak in order to fit my website. I want to be able to use Bootstrap to help with layouts and it helped, but I want to be more effective with it in the future.
